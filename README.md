# SortedSingleLinkedList
I am just starting to learn JavaScript and figured a good way to familarize myself with the new language was to make something similar to what I have made in the past with C++ (language I have the most experience with)

This is a fairly simple linked list, with the main complexity coming from the fact that the items in the list are arranged in order according to their value. This also means that nodes can be added/removed from anywhere in the linked list, unlike the stack+queue I have already implemented.

For the sake of simplicity, I am only considering the case where all items in the list are of **number** type. 

My end goal is to implement a single linked list that takes user input to perform the following five functions:

1. insert a value
2. remove a value
3. print the entire list
4. search the list for a specific value
5. close the program

Along with this README file, this repository contains:
  1. a JavaScript file with the entire implementation of the sll stack (SortedSingleLinkedList.js)
  2. an html file to run said JavaScript file (SortedSingleLinkedList.html)
    
    -I plan to expand on this when I get the chance to learn more about html
  
This program is intended for personal education, and I plan on updating it as I learn more
